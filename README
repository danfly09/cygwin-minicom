## README ##

Forked branch from original project and adapted to compile in cygwin for Windows. The original project can be found at <br>
https://salsa.debian.org/minicom-team/minicom/-/tree/master

Your COM ports are mapped as /dev/ttyS# <br>
COM1 will be /dev/ttyS0 and so on. 

Tested it on the following machine but I believe it 
should run on any Windows machine with Cygwin installed

   `Windows 10 Home` <br>
   `Version	21H2` <br>
   `OS build	19044.1645`

**Remember:** to install <br>
`gcc-core, gcc-g++, make, autoconf, gettext,  libncurses-devel, libiconv-devel`

I believe those were all the packages needed but I might be 
forgetting one or two as I had to come back over and over every
time the compilation failed. 

**TODO:** Add/Update autocheck scripts to make sure you have all required packages before running make. 

Quick instructions:
-------------------

1. git clone <this-repository>
2. cd minicom
3. ./autogen.sh
4. ./configure (see ./configure --help for options)
5. make
6. make install
